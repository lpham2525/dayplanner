# Work Day Scheduler

Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar application that allows the user to add and save events for each hour of the work day from 8 am to 6 pm. Timeblocks representing hours past will display as gray blocks, the present hour will be highlighted as a light red block, and hours in the future will be depicted as light green blocks. This app features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
